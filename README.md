- [2020 in Haskell](https://github.com/dfm/adventofcode/tree/2020)

- [2022 in C++20](https://github.com/dfm/adventofcode/tree/2022)

It's not pretty, but sometimes it works(?):

## Usage Notes

**Session key:** To automatically download the inputs for a specific day, you'll
need to have your AofC session key saved somewhere. To find it, log into [the
AoC website](https://adventofcode.com), and use the developer tools to look at
the cookies to find your session key. Then save that key to a file called
`~/.config/aoc/key`.
