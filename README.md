My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

2021 in Rust. Previous years:

- [2019 in C++](https://github.com/dfm/adventofcode/tree/2019)
- [2020 in Haskell](https://github.com/dfm/adventofcode/tree/2020)

It's not pretty, but sometimes it works(?):

## Usage notes

**Session key**:
To automatically download the inputs for a specific day, you'll need to have
your AofC session key saved somewhere. To find it, log in on
https://adventofcode.com, and use the developer tools to look at the cookies to
find your session key. Then save that key to a file called `.aoc` in the root of
this repo, or as the `AOC_SESSION_KEY` environment variable.
