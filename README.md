- [2020 in Haskell](https://github.com/dfm/adventofcode/tree/2020)
- [2021 in Rust](https://github.com/dfm/adventofcode/tree/2021)

It's not pretty, but sometimes it works(?):

## Usage notes

**Session key**: To automatically download the inputs for a specific day, you'll
need to have your AofC session key saved somewhere. To find it, log into [the
AoC website](https://adventofcode.com), and use the developer tools to look at
the cookies to find your session key. Then save that key to a file called
`~/.config/aoc/key`.
